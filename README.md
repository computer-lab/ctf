The __Computer Lab CTF__ will be an information security Capture the Flag (CTF)
event hosted by [Computer Lab](https://computerlab.io) somewhere in New York
City. An infosec CTF is a hacking wargame where the organizer hides digital
"flags" on a network of computer systems, and participants attempt to find
vulnerabilites that allow them to compromise systems and exfiltrate flags.

There's a history of infosec CTFs dating back to the mid-90s, where a CTF became
the centerpiece of the DEFCON hacking conference. The DEFCON CTF has developed
into a complex attack/defend style competition where teams must both patch their
own vulnerable systems and try to exploit others. In recent years, other groups
have developed different flavors of CTF to suit different audiences and the CTF
is quickly becoming an alternative to the product-oriented "hackathon" events
popular in Silicon Valley.

The Computer Lab CTF will introduce three main twists:

1. Many flags will be private keys that unlock valuable crytocurrency wallets.

2. It will be narrative-focused. Data on challenge servers and devices will
   serve as environmental storytelling.

3. Challenges will aim to empower tech workers outside of the security industry. 

We hope to help our developer friends leverage existing skillsets to
**HACK** in a very fun and aesthetic way.
