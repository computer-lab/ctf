# ctf

The _Computer Lab CTF_ will be an information security Capture the Flag (CTF)
event. A infosec CTF is a hacking wargame where an organizer hides digital
"flags" on a network of computer systems, and participants attempt to find
vulnerabilites that allow them to own systems and exfiltrate flags.

Infosec CTFs date back the mid-90s, where they became the centerpiece of the
DEFCON hacking conference. The DEFCON CTF has developed into a complex
attack/defend competition where teams must both patch their own vulnerable
systems and try to exploit others. In recent years, other groups have developed
different flavors of CTF to suit different audiences, and the CTF has become an
alternative to the product-oriented "Hackathon" model.

The Computer Lab CTF will introduce three main twists:

1. Flags will often be private keys that unlock crytocurrency wallets containing
   real tokens.

2. It will be narrative-focused. Data on the challenge servers and devices will
   be used for environmental storytelling.

3. Challenges will aim to empower tech workers outside of the security industry. 

We hope to help our developer friends leverage their existing skillsets to
**HACK**, and we want it to be very fun and aesthetic.
